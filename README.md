A component of the `portal-gun` ephemeral virtual machine management system.
Providing Multiverse OS developers reproducible build environments, and the
foundation for Multiverse OS compartmentalization based security protocol.

**TODO:** Emulate/Model the virtual keyboard in a more realistic way; such as,
add a boolean to track <capslock>, <numlock>, and status of other similar
toggle keys.

**TODO:** Support simple multi-key pressing

**TODO:** Support Unicode

**TODO:** Support simpler API allowing TypeString("string to type")...

**TODO:** Support macro definition, as one could with a more advanced
keyboard

**TODO:** Begin to sketch out some of the additional hardware functionality in
the Multiverse open source hardware HID spec.

Keep logic in uinput releated to uninput, logic that abstracts and keeps track
of window/process being interacted with, should be at the higher level of
virtual.

**TODO:** Instead of taking in Int perhaps take in KeyCode type
